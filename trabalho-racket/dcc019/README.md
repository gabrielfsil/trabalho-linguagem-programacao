DCC019 - Linguagens de Programação
======

This repository contains the language examples I use in the programming language course I teach.
All of them are based on the material of the Essential of Programming Languages book.

To use these examples, you must clone the project by running the following command
```bash
raco pkg install
```

Alternatively, you can open the DrRacket and install the collection using the DrRacket's Package Manager.
